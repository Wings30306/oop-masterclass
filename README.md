# UCD MASTERCLASS 3

In this repo you can find the code we went through on the debugging section. It has the code for the leap year function (full version as well as the refactored and one-line versions) and PEP8 demonstration code to fix too long lines.

Good luck with Portfolio Project 3, everyone!
